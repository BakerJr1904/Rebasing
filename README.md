# Rebasing
Lets play with rebasing<br/>
The git rebase command allows you to easily change a series of commits, modifying the history of your repository. You can reorder, edit, or squash commits together. Typically, you would use git rebase to: Combine multiple commits into one. Delete or revert commits that are no longer necessary.<br/>
